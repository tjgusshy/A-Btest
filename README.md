# A/B Test

Wayne E-commerce store has been using a particular type of webpage for more than two years now and is considering if there is a need to change the current webpage or to stick to the current one.

So as not to take the wrong decision, they reached out to their data analyst in order to use data to make their decision whether to change the current webpage or to stick to the current one.

As the data analyst, you are told to carry out an A|B test, so that the organisation will be sure that they are not taking the wrong decision.

After weeks of planning and carrying out a randomized sample for two weeks and after getting the required sample size, the data analyt set out to work.

Let us get familiar with what an A|B test is first and how the data was collected.

An A/B test is a randomized controlled experiment (assuming it meets the conditions of controlled factors and randomized users).

## Randomized

Randomization is mainly involved in the equation to remove hidden bias from an experiment. It gives us the ability to say that our results were actually caused by a certain improvement or change in the current way of doing things (in the context of A/B testing).

## Controlled

It is controlled because we have a control group and a treatment group, where the control group is assigned the current way of things, and the treatment group is assigned the new way of things. This allows us to compare our results with something; in other words, the control group is our baseline.

To put this all together, in the context of a web page design, users will be randomly sampled and randomly assigned treatment by splitting into the control and the treatment groups. The control group would see the original version of the page, and the treatment group will see the new design.

For this project, there will be four sections, which includes:

Explanatory analysis

statistical analysis

Observations

Recommendation


### Observations

The new webpage amassed more visitors and more conversion rate than the old webpage.

Both webpage had a total visitors of 1451.

We had more unconverted(1394) visits than converted visits(57) for both webpage or variants

Length of stay for B(125) is higher than the length of stay for A(113).

After carrying out hypothesis test, the result showed that the difference between the conversion rate is not due to mere chance, and are statistically different.

WE are 95% confident that conversion rate for A is lower than the conversion rate of B.

### Recommendation

The organisation can go ahead and change the webpage to the new one,as this will bring in more customers for the organisation and will result in more revenue.
